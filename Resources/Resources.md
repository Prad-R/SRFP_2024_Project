## Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC)

Below, the content related to the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_simulation_Monte_Carlo) is mentioned.

- **General Info**
	- The DSMC method is used whenever the Knudsen number is of other order of 1. Right now used in MEMS and Space Shuttle Re-entry Aerodynamics.
	- It models fluid flows using probabilistic simulation molecules to solve the [Boltzmann Equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_equation).
- **DSMC Algorithm**
	- State of the system is given by the positions and velocities of the particles $\{ \vec{r}, \vec{v} \}$.
	- Each DSMC particle represents $F_N$ particles in physical space with approximately the same positions and velocities.
