\chapter*{Abstract}

Proposed by Graeme Bird in 1963, the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method has been steadily gaining popularity in the scientific community, owing to both its robustness, rapidly improving computational power, and parallelization paradigms. This work starts by looking into some fundamental assumptions that continuum fluid mechanics is based on, explores the conditions under which these fail, and later explores some alternative techniques to model fluid flow. Additionally, a DSMC tool called SPARTA will be looked into, and existing studies showing its validity will be summarized. After this, the work moves on to discuss some simulations that have been set up, and their agreement with the predicted results will be scrutinized. Finally, some possible future directions for the work are discussed, detailing a research direction involving investigating fluid flow in Martian atmospheric conditions.
