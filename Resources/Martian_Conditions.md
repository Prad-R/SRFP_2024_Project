## Martian Conditions

The data presented below are obtained from the following sources : -

1. [Martian Climate Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_of_Mars)
2. [Mars Atmospheric Data Archive](https://atmos.nmsu.edu/data_and_services/atmospheres_data/MARS/data_archive.html)

### Temperature

- The surface temperature is said to reach $` 20^\circ `$ in noon at the equator. The Viking landers have measured temmperatures from 166K to 256K. The warmest soil temperature has been about 300K. Temperatures are usually above 273K except during the winter.[^1]
- For point-by-point footpad temperature sensor data measured by the Viking Landers, the relevant files are included in [VL_Point-by-Point_Footpad_Temp](Climatic_Data/Martian/VL_Point-by-Point_Footpad_Temp).[^2]
- For average footpad temperature sensor data measured by the Viking Landers, the relevant files are included in [VL_Average_Footpad_Temp](Climatic_Data/Martian/VL_Avg_Footpad_Temp).[^2]
- The footpad temperature data aren't very accurate owing to large conduction and radiation errors. These errors are not easy to correct either.


### Atmospheric Pressure

- The Martian atmosphere is mainly made of $` CO_2 `$ and has a mean atmospheric pressure of 600 Pa (for reference, the atmospheric pressure on Earth at sea level is about 101,000 Pa). A direct effect of this is that the Martian surface is subject to strong thermal tides. Liquid water is unstable on the surface as the atmospheric pressure is lesser than the triple point of water.[^1]
